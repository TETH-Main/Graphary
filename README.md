This library full of math graph art. Search for abundant functions and figures by tag and find hints for creation.

## Translation

This project supports multiple languages. To add a new language, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `locales/translations` directory. Name the file using the language code (e.g., `fr.js` for French).
2. Copy the structure of an existing translation file (e.g., `en.js` or `ja.js`) and translate the text values.
3. Add the new translation file to the HTML file where translations are needed.
4. Update the `loadTranslations` function in `js/translate.js` to load the appropriate translation file based on the `lang` URL parameter.
